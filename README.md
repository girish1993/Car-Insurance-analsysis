# Car Insurance Policy - Inferential Modeling

<p>
    The Car insurance Policy dataset provides a set of attributes and also indicates whether the consumer purchased the insurance policy. This is a business optimisation problem where the problem models a realistic problem of ascertaining the most significant features of the dataset. These features would then be used by the insurance service provider company to provide value added services to a specific segment in the consumer space. Additionally, the indentification of the most significant features will provide a blue print to emphasize on the most important attributes and to de-clutter the problem space.
